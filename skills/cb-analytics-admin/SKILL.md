  Use this skill when the user wants to inspect or manage the Analytics
  service's runtime — checking ingestion health, killing runaway queries,
  restarting nodes, or diagnosing performance. Trigger when they mention
  "ingestion status", "active queries", "completed requests", "restart
  service", "cancel request", "service status", or "Analytics health".

# Analytics service admin

You have 7 tools for runtime management.

## Status snapshot (read-only, safe)

- `get_service_status(cluster)` — overall service state, replica lag,
  authorised node list
- `get_ingestion_status(cluster)` — per-link ingestion state, pending ops
- `get_active_requests(cluster)` — what's running right now
- `get_completed_requests(client_context_id=None, cluster)` — recent
  history; pass `client_context_id` to filter to one request

## Diagnostic workflow

When a user says "queries are slow" or "ingestion looks stuck":

1. `get_service_status` — is the service even healthy? Watch `ccRevLag`
   (replication lag).
2. `get_ingestion_status` — for each link, look at `pendingOperations`. A
   non-zero pending count after a quiet period usually means a stuck link.
3. `get_active_requests` — long-running queries appear here with
   `elapsedTime`. Anything over a few seconds is suspect.
4. `get_completed_requests` — look for a pattern of errors or unusually
   long durations.

## Destructive operations (use with care)

- `cancel_request(client_context_id, cluster)` — abort one in-flight query.
  Get the id from `get_active_requests`.
- `restart_node(cluster)` — restart only the Analytics process on the
  local node. May briefly disrupt queries routed to that node.
- `restart_service(cluster)` — **cluster-wide** Analytics restart. All
  active queries fail. Don't suggest this lightly; warn the user.

## Confirmation patterns

When the user asks to cancel or restart anything, **always confirm** by
naming what you're about to do, with the specific request id or cluster
name. Example:

> Cancel request `cb-12345` on cluster `prod`? This will return an error
> to whichever client issued it.

After they confirm, run the tool and report success or failure based on
the returned `ok` field.

## What to avoid

- Don't restart the service to "fix" a slow query — try cancelling it first.
- Don't call `cancel_request` on a `client_context_id` that's already
  completed; it's a no-op but generates a confusing error.
- Don't poll `get_active_requests` aggressively (e.g. every second). Once
  per few seconds is fine.

## Rate limits & safety

Admin tools split across two rate-limit categories:

- **`read`** (60/sec): `get_service_status`, `get_ingestion_status`,
  `get_active_requests`, `get_completed_requests`.
- **`write`** (1/sec, intentionally conservative): `cancel_request`,
  `restart_service`, `restart_node`.

The write bucket is small on purpose. Cancelling one runaway query per
second is plenty; restarting a service every second would be madness.
If a `RateLimitExceeded` response comes back, the response includes
`retry_after_sec` — honour it. Don't retry-storm; that just keeps the
bucket empty.

Status calls share the read bucket with every other read-only tool across
the server (list_users, list_clusters, ping_cluster, etc.). If you're
polling status in a loop, keep the interval ≥ 2 seconds so the bucket
stays healthy for other concurrent work.
